3D-Design-Dataset
Overview
The dataset is not applicable to advancing AI technologies. The shared dataset of 3D CAD files and technical documents, accessed securely via PLM and visualized through XR applications over 5G, has enabled a fast, collaborative, and effective design environment. Leveraging 5G infrastructure ensures simultaneous data transfer and high responsiveness, which is key to improving the overall user experience and advancing real-time design workflows. 

Dataset Contents/Dataset Description
This dataset is collected to visualize 3D designs using XR technology on a 5G network infrastructure. Designers can quickly access product 3D design data and technical specifications from the Product Lifecycle Management (PLM) system and perform real-time work on the designs. This dataset will support performance testing, algorithm optimization, and network design tasks for 5G XR applications.
Computer aided design (CAD) data is converted to universal and optimized JT data for the VR system. These data are used throughout the product lifecycle with 2D and 3D visualizations. 
This dataset inclueds; 
•	Visual/data access speed for the VR system 
•	Conversion time to different formats 
•	Visualization quality in the VR environment 
•	User interactions and success rates 
Jupiter Tessellation (JT) is an efficient, industry-focused, flexible 3D data format developed by Siemens PLM Software, ISO standardized. 
X_T files are 3D product part models created with the Parasolid solid modeling kernel. 
STEP (STP) files contain standard 3D product models used in CAD and engineering. 
Extensible Markup Language (XML) is used for encoding documents in a format that is both human-readable and machine-readable. 
PDF is a format for presenting documents independent of application software, hardware, and operating systems.
